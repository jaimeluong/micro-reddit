# Micro-Reddit

This is the Micro-Reddit project from The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails curriculum. It contains 3 models with the relevant associations: User, Posts, and Comment. Although there is no front-end, users can make a number of posts and comment on such posts with Active Record managing the relationship between the app and SQLite3 database. There are data validations enforced on all three models as well as a series of migrations.
